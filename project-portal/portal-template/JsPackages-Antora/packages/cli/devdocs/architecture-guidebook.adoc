== Context

Antora needs an interface that can be used to launch it--typically the site generator--from a command-line prompt or script.
This package should add the `antora` command to the user's PATH when installed.
The `antora` command (or application) should be capable of showing usage documentation, which should list the options (flags and switches), (sub)commands, arguments, and environment variables that it accepts as input.

NOTE: We use the term application for this module instead of component since, unlike the other modules, this is an application the user will install from npmjs.com (i.e., `npm install -g @antora/cli`).

== Functional Overview

The main purpose of the command-line interface (CLI) is to give the user a way to execute functionality provided by Antora using the `antora` command.
The `antora` command accepts input from the user in the form of command-line arguments and environment variables, determines which action to perform, then delegates the work to other components or component pipelines in Antora.
It should not perform any work that's otherwise handled by other components.

We anticipate having to use this command to perform different actions (e.g., generate, validate, new, etc.).
Therefore, it should be designed as a command-style (aka action-style) interface, where the first positional argument following the name of the command is the action to perform (e.g., `antora generate`).
The core components and add-ons may be loaded statically or dynamically depending on the action.
To reduce burden on the user, we'll assume the implicit command `generate` if no command is specified explicitly (e.g., `antora`).

The `generate` command should build and register its options based on the playbook schema.
It shouldn't validate the option values, but rather delegate to the playbook builder component to handle that step.
If a generator, the `generate` command should load and use the provided site generator.

If an error (or errors) occurs during execution, the error message(s) should be displayed in a readable format for the user and the command should exit with a status of 1.
Otherwise, the command should exit with a status of 0.

== Software Architecture

The CLI is provided by the cli module.
This module should expose the `antora` bin script.

The `antora` command should be implemented using a command-line interface library such as https://github.com/tj/commander.js[commander.js].
It should be implemented as a single-level command-style (aka action-style) interface (e.g., `antora generate`).

The `generate` command should accept the form `antora generate [options] <playbook>`.
The options should be built from the playbook schema.
The playbook argument should be rewritten as the `playbook` option (to adhere to what the playbook builder accepts).
If a generator, it should be loaded.
If no generator is specified, the provided site generator should be loaded.
The arguments array and environment variables should then be passed to the generator.

If executed with no arguments, the `help` command (i.e., `antora help`), or the `-h` switch (i.e., `antora -h`), usage statement should be displayed.
The usage statement should show the description, common options, and list of commands.
If a command is specified after the `help` command (i.e., `antora help generate`), or the `-h` switch is passed to a command (i.e., `antora generate -h`), the usage statement for that command should be displayed.

If executed with the `-v` switch (i.e., `antora -v`), the command should show the version of the CLI.

.Inputs
* Command-line arguments and environment variables

.Output
* Messages written to STDOUT and STDERR
* Exit code

== Code

The CLI is implemented as a dedicated node package (i.e., module).
The module exposes the `antora` bin script, which is added to the user's PATH when the module is installed.

CLI usage examples:

.Display the usage statement (implicit)
 $ antora

.Display the usage statement (explicit)
 $ antora -h

.Display the CLI version
 $ antora -v

.Display the usage statement for the generate command
 $ antora generate -h

.Run the generate command
 $ antora generate antora-playbook.yml

.Run the generate command with additional options
 $ antora generate --to-dir site --html-url-extension-style=indexify antora-playbook.yml

== Data

The only data this module works with are command-line arguments and environment variables.
It should restrict command-line arguments (which consist of options and unnamed arguments) to those that a given command accepts.

== Consequences

The CLI is the primary means by which users (i.e., site authors) will interface with Antora.
The CLI provides a way to interact with, configure, customize, and ultimately launch the Antora tooling.

Without a CLI, the only way users could use Antora is to invoke it programmatically.
While there are users who will choose to take this approach, the CLI is crucial for putting Antora in the hands of the general purpose user.
The interface also provides "`in app`" documentation (aka usage) that allows the user to discover functionality in Antora.

The command-style interface gives the application the ability to be expanded to support additional actions without requiring the user to install additional interfaces.
The ability for the command to load add-on code allows the same interface to be used to invoke custom behavior and pipelines.
