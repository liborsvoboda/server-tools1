= Asciidoctor Upgrade Notes

Antora 3 uses Asciidoctor.js 2.2.x (Asciidoctor 2.0.x) instead of Asciidoctor.js 1.5.9 (Asciidoctor 1.5.8) to process content files.
Asciidoctor 2 introduces many new features and a few substantive changes to existing features.

== Asciidoctor 2 feature changes

The following sections describe the new behavior of existing Asciidoctor features and suggest the actions you should take prior to upgrading from Antora 2 to Antora 3.

=== Non-AsciiDoc files and the include directive

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Including non-AsciiDoc files using the include directive, particularly inside verbatim (listing, literal, or source) blocks
|Trailing space characters aren't removed, tabs aren't expanded, and newlines aren't normalized when including a non-AsciiDoc file using the include directive.
This can change how the output is displayed.
.3+.^a|* Update non-AsciiDoc files that use a mix of tabs and spaces or inconsistent newlines if their content isn't displaying as expected when published.
* Replace any tabs in non-AsciiDoc files if the `indent` attribute is set but not working as expected.
* Remove trailing space characters from non-AsciiDoc files, especially if using callouts in the file content or applying the `indent` attribute.

|Including non-AsciiDoc files with the `indent` attribute set on the include directive or verbatim block into which they're inserted
|Since tabs aren't expanded in the non-AsciiDoc content, the `indent` attribute may not work as expected.

|Including non-AsciiDoc files with callouts into a verbatim block using the include directive
|Since trailing spaces aren't removed, callout numbers may no longer be detected.
|===

=== Listing and source blocks

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Delimited listing blocks without an explicit style when `source-language` is set
|Delimited listing blocks (`+----+`) that don't have an explicit style are automatically promoted to source blocks if `source-language` is set in the document, component descriptor, or playbook.
This may result in unwanted syntax highlighting.
a|If `source-language` isn't set, you don't need to take any action.

If `source-language` is set, do the following:

* Assign the style `listing` to any unstyled delimited listing blocks that shouldn't be promoted to source blocks.
You can also change them to delimited literal blocks (`+....+`).
* (optional) Remove the style `source` from delimited listing blocks that should be promoted to source blocks.
The `source` style is applied automatically.

See xref:asciidoc:source.adoc[] to learn more.

|Source blocks that aren't assigned a language
|The language `none` is automatically assigned to source blocks (`source`) when no language is set on the block or by `source-language`.

The block is styled like other source blocks, but no syntax highlighting is applied.
a|If this behavior is acceptable, no change is needed.
Otherwise, do one of the following:

* assign the appropriate language to the source block, or
* remove the `source` style and replace it with the `listing` style, or
* remove the `source` style and change the block to a delimited literal block (`+....+`).

See xref:asciidoc:source.adoc[] to learn more.

=== Tables

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|`a` and `l` column modifiers
|Normal substitutions and default header formatting are now correctly applied to the cells in an implicit header row when the AsciiDoc (`a`) and literal (`l`) modifiers are applied to the columns in a table.
|Update tables that use the `a` and `l` modifiers in combination with an implicit header row so your desired output is displayed.

|`v` modifier
|The verse modifier (`v`) is deprecated.
Columns or cells assigned the `v` modifier are now treated as regular table cells.
|No action is needed if it's acceptable for the cell content to be displayed as regular content.

|`table-topbot` CSS class
|The CSS class `table-ends` replaces the deprecated `table-topbot` CSS class.
|If you customized the styles for `table-topbot` in your UI, update the class name to `table-ends` and build a new UI bundle version.

|Table column width
|The rounding used when calculating table column widths changed minutely.
|No action is needed as the change shouldn't be noticeable to site visitors.
|===

=== Lists

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Description list delimiters (`::`)
|Description list delimiters, that is, double colons (`::`) that are bare or at the start of line are no longer mistaken for a description list item.
|Remove escape syntax around double colons (`::`) that were previously mistaken for description list delimiters.
|===

=== Section and block titles

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Section and block title substitution order
|The order of substitutions applied to section and block titles now matches the normal substitution order.
This can affect section and block titles that use attribute references.
|Review section and block titles that contain attribute references for errors.
|===

=== Invalid and unresolved references and attributes

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|"`Unresolved include directive`" message in the content
|The message has changed to "`Unresolved directive`".
|No action unless you're using a postprocessor that looks for this message in the output.

|`page` class
|The class `page` for xrefs has been replaced with `xref <family>`, where `<family>` is the name of the family of the resource to which the xref points (e.g., `xref page`).
|You will need to update the selector in your CSS or postprocessor if it attempts to match this class.
You can now find all xref links in the page using the CSS selector `a.xref`.

|`page unresolved` class
|The class `page unresolved` has been replaced with `xref unresolved` when the target of an xref is invalid or could not be resolved.
|You will need to update the selector in your CSS or postprocessor if it attempts to match this class.

|Reference validation for inline anchor
|If Asciidoctor cannot locate a reference to an inline anchor, even if it exists, it will log a message at the info level about a possible invalid reference.
|Define inline anchors using the double square bracket enclosure, and only place them in locations where Asciidoctor scans for them.
Valid locations include anywhere in paragraph text or at the start of a list item or table cell.
You could also ignore these messages or not enable the info log level.

|`attribute-missing`
|The `attribute-missing` setting is now honored when include directives and block macros are processed.
This may reveal new missing include files and references.
|Check the log messages for new warnings and fix any reported errors.
|===

=== Footnotes

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Footnote macro
|The `footnoteref` macro is deprecated and the structure of the `footnote` macro has changed to be consistent with other AsciiDoc macros.
Previously, the footnote target was placed inside the macro's square brackets.
Now the target is placed directly after the colon (`+footnote:<target>[<optional attributes>]+`).
|Change `footnoteref` to `footnote` and move the footnote target to the correct position.

|Anchors and xrefs in footnotes
|Anchor and xref macros are processed before footnote macros so that footnote macros aren't terminated prematurely.
|Remove escape syntax, such as a backslash (`+\+`), from anchor and xref macros used inside footnote macro attribute lists.
|===

=== Quote block

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|`""` quote block delimiter
|The 2-character `""` quote block delimiter is deprecated.
|Remove the deprecated `""` delimiters and replace with the `quote` block style with the four underscores (`+____+`) block delimiters or quote paragraph syntax.
|===

=== Encoding

|===
|Feature |New behavior |Action

|Encode characters in email address to comply with RFC-3986
|Previously, spaces in an email address were encoded as `%20`.
Now, spaces are encoded as a plus sign (`{plus}`) in email addresses to comply with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent#Description[RFC-3986].
|This change will not affect the behavior of email links.
|===

== Semantic versioning and Asciidoctor 2

Starting with Asciidoctor 2.0.0, Asciidoctor and Asciidoctor.js switched to semantic versioning.
This allows Antora to automatically pick up the latest patch versions of Asciidoctor.js during installation without having to make a new Antora release available.

NOTE: Ready to upgrade from Antora 2 to Antora {page-component-version}?
See xref:install:upgrade-antora.adoc[] for instructions.
