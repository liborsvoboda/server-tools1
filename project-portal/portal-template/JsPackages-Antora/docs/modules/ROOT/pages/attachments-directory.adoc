= Attachments Directory and Files

[#attachments-dir]
== Attachments family directory

A module directory can contain a xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] named [.path]_attachments_.

[listing]
----
📂 modules
  📂 ROOT <.>
    📂 attachments <.>
      📄 attachment-source-file.ext <.>
    📁 images
    📁 pages
    📄 nav.adoc
----
<.> A ROOT module directory.
<.> An [.path]_attachments_ family directory.
Antora classifies source files stored in an [.path]_attachments_ directory as attachments.
<.> An attachment source file.

The [.path]_attachments_ directory is optional.
Antora applies preset behavior to the files stored in an [.path]_attachments_ directory when it generates a site.

[#attachments]
== Attachment files

An attachment is typically a file a site visitor views or downloads using their browser, such as a PDF or the ZIP archive of a sample project.

At runtime, Antora automatically:

* Loads each file from an [.path]_attachments_ directory into the Antora content catalog, except for files xref:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[marked as hidden or missing a file extension]
* Assigns each loaded attachment file to the attachment family
* Assigns each loaded attachment a xref:page:resource-id.adoc[unique resource ID] for source-to-source referencing
* Publishes each loaded attachment file as an individual page in a site, except for files xref:standard-directories.adoc#unpublished[marked as unpublished]

Using an attachment's resource ID, you can xref:page:attachments.adoc[cross reference an attachment] from other pages, resources, or navigation files in your site.
Antora uses the family directory, __attachments__-relative directory path (if present), filename, and file extension of the attachment when xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc[building the URL of an attachment].

=== Binaries and other large files

If your content includes large attachment files, such as sample project binaries, libraries, or PDFs, we don't recommend storing them in a regular git repository.
Instead, host them in a binary repository such as S3, or use git LFS (Large File Storage).
