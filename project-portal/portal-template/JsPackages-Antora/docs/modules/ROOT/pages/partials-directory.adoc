<.> A ROOT module directory.
<.> A [.path]_partials_ family directory.
Antora classifies source files stored in a [.path]_partials_ directory as partials.
<.> A partial file marked up with the AsciiDoc syntax and saved with the _.adoc_ file extension.
<.> A named module directory.
<.> A [.path]_partials_ family directory.
<.> A subdirectory in [.path]_partials_.
Source files stored in subdirectories of a [.path]_partials_ directory are classified as partials.

The [.path]_partials_ directory is optional.
Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in the [.path]_partials_ directory when it generates a site.

[#partials]
== Partial files

Antora classifies the source files stored in a [.path]_partials_ directory as partial files, or partials for short.
Partials are usually AsciiDoc files that contain content snippets, such as common descriptions or terminology, that are inserted into one or more pages or partials.
However, Antora doesn't require partials to be AsciiDoc files.

include::page:page$partials.adoc[tag=filename]

A partial isn't required to have a file extension.
Unlike a publishable resource that's treated as a xref:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[hidden file] if it's missing a file extension, Antora will load a partial that doesn't have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the partial a resource ID for referencing.

Antora doesn't publish partial files as individual site pages.
A xref:page:include-a-partial.adoc[partial must be referenced by an include directive] from a page, or resource that's eventually included in a page, for the partial's content to be published.

// tag::extension[]
IMPORTANT: Except when it's typical for a file type to not have a file extension, it's a good practice to save your partial source files with their valid file extensions.
// end::extension[]
