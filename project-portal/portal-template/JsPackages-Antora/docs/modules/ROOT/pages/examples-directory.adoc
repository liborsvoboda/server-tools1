[#examples-dir]
== Examples family directory

A module directory can contain a xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] named [.path]_examples_.

<.> A ROOT module directory.
<.> An [.path]_examples_ family directory.
Antora classifies source files stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory as examples.
<.> An example source file.
<.> A named module directory.
<.> An [.path]_examples_ family directory.
<.> An example source file without a file extension.
Antora will load example source files without extensions into the content catalog.
<.> A subdirectory in [.path]_examples_.
Source files stored in subdirectories of an [.path]_examples_ directory are classified as examples.

The [.path]_examples_ directory is optional.
Antora applies preset behavior to the source files stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory when it generates a site.

[#examples]
== Example files

Antora classifies the source files stored in an [.path]_examples_ directory as examples.
Example files usually contain content such as source code samples, terminal output, data sets, etc.

include::page:page$examples.adoc[tag=filename]

An example file isn't required to have a file extension.
Unlike a publishable resource that's treated as a xref:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[hidden file] if it's missing a file extension, Antora will load an example that doesn't have a file extension into its content catalog and assign the example a resource ID for referencing.

Antora doesn't publish example files as individual site pages.
An xref:page:include-an-example.adoc[example must be referenced by an include directive] from a page, or resource that's eventually included in a page, for the example's content to be published.

IMPORTANT: Except when it's typical for a file type to not have a file extension, such as [.path]_Dockerfile_, it's a good practice to save your example source files with their valid file extensions.
Otherwise, you may not be able to use some Antora or Asciidoctor extensions that apply additional behavior to example files.

TIP: Examples shouldn't be confused with the AsciiDoc example block, though an example file can be inserted into an example block using an include directive.
