= Pages Directory and Files

[#pages-dir]
== Pages family directory

A module directory can contain a xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] named [.path]_pages_.
The [.path]_pages_ directory can contain subdirectories.
Only AsciiDoc source files with the file extension _.adoc_ should be stored in the [.path]_pages_ directory and its subdirectories because Antora applies preset behavior to page files when it runs.

<.> A named module directory.
<.> A [.path]_pages_ family directory.
Source files stored in [.path]_pages_ are classified as pages.
<.> A page file marked up with the AsciiDoc syntax and saved with the valid _.adoc_ file extension.
<.> A subdirectory in [.path]_pages_.
Source files stored in subdirectories of a [.path]_pages_ directory are classified as pages.
<.> A ROOT module directory.
<.> A [.path]_pages_ family directory.

The [.path]_pages_ directory is optional.
That is, if a module doesn't have any page files, don't create a [.path]_pages_ directory in the module.
If you set up a [.path]_pages_ directory, the [.path]_pages_ directory or a subdirectory of [.path]_pages_ must contain at least one AsciiDoc source file.

[#pages]
== Page files

Antora classifies the source files stored in a [.path]_pages_ directory as pages.
Pages are structured as individual documents with a title, marked up using the AsciiDoc syntax, and saved with the _.adoc_ file extension.
Using a page's resource ID, you can xref:page:xref.adoc[cross reference a page] from other pages, resources, or navigation files in your site or xref:page:include-a-page.adoc[include a page] into other pages or resources in your site.

A page file is a xref:page:resource-id.adoc#publishable[publishable resource] unless it's marked as xref:standard-directories.adoc#hidden-files[hidden or unpublished].
That means Antora automatically converts each page to HTML and publishes it as an individual page in a site, even if the page isn't referenced by another resource or navigation file.
Antora uses the __pages__-relative directory path (if present), filename of the page, and specified HTML extension style when xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc[building the URL of a page].
