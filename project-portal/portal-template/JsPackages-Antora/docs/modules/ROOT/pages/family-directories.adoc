= Family Directories and Families

Antora assigns preset, content-specific behavior to the source files stored in the family directories.

[#family-dir]
== What's a family directory?

A [.term]*family directory* groups source files that share the same function, processing requirements, and publishing rules.
Antora recognizes five standard family directories: [.path]_attachments_, [.path]_examples_, [.path]_images_, [.path]_pages_, and [.path]_partials_.

Each family directory is optional.
You only need to create a family directory if you have source files that should be stored in a specific family directory.
That is, if a module doesn't have any image files, don't create an [.path]_images_ directory.
Set up the family directories you need at the root of a xref:module-directories.adoc#module-dir[module directory].
At runtime, Antora collects the source files stored in the family directories and assigns them to the corresponding <<family,family>>.

[#family]
== What's a family?

A [.term]*family* is a classification Antora applies to each source file collected from a family directory.
The assigned family corresponds to the name of the family directory.
The families are:

* xref:attachments-directory.adoc[attachments]
* xref:examples-directory.adoc[examples]
* xref:images-directory.adoc[images]
* xref:pages-directory.adoc[pages]
* xref:partials-directory.adoc[partials]

Each source file is configured, converted, and published according to the preset behavior associated with its assigned family.

TIP: A source file that is assigned to a family is often referred to as xref:page:resource-id.adoc[resource].
Antora assigns each resource that it catalogs a xref:page:resource-id.adoc#whats-a-resource-id[unique Antora resource ID] that consists of five coordinates.
One coordinate of the resource ID represents the family of the resource.
