= ROOT Module Directory

[#root-dir]
== What's a ROOT module directory?

The [.path]_ROOT_ directory is an xref:module-directories.adoc#module-dir[optional module directory].
A [.path]_ROOT_ module directory is located in a xref:module-directories.adoc#modules-dir[_modules_ directory], and its name must be written in all uppercase letters.
A [.path]_ROOT_ directory stores content source files in one or more of the xref:family-directories.adoc[family directories].

If the [.path]_ROOT_ module directory is present, it must contain at least one xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] with at least one source file.
It can also contain an optional navigation file.

The source files stored in a [.path]_ROOT_ directory become part of a <<root-module,ROOT module>> in a component version.
We recommended that you create a [.path]_ROOT_ module directory because Antora applies special preset behavior to the publishable resources in a <<root-module,ROOT module>>.
For example, the source file [.path]_index.adoc_ in the [.path]_pages_ directory becomes the xref:component-start-page.adoc#default-start-page[default start page] for a component version.
Those familiar with the terminology of HTML web hosting will recognize this as the index page for a component version.

Small documentation projects may never need more than a [.path]_ROOT_ module directory.
However, as your project grows, you can easily add more module directories and gradually reorganize your source files.
While the extra structure seems like overkill now, in the long run, you'll be glad you gave your content the space to grow.

[#root-module]
== What's a ROOT module?

Source files that are stored in a [.path]_ROOT_ directory become part of a module named `ROOT` in a xref:component-version.adoc[component version].
A ROOT module's pages become the top-level pages of a component version.
In other words, unlike other modules, the name of the ROOT module does not get used in the generated site.

You can think of the name "`ROOT`" as an alias for a blank module name (i.e., no module segment).
Using this special value allows all modules to be siblings.

It's important to carefully consider what files you store in a [.path]_ROOT_ module directory since there is a potential for them to conflict with files in the named module directories.
Generally, the ROOT module doesn't use topic folders for this reason.

[#where-root-name-is-used]
== Where's the ROOT module name used?

When you reference content that belongs to a ROOT module from another module or component version, you'll specify the module name `ROOT` in the xref:page:resource-id.adoc[resource IDs] for pages, attachments, images, examples, and partials.
`ROOT` is always written in uppercase letters when it's specified.

Since Antora considers the pages in a ROOT module to be top-level component version pages, the module name `ROOT` isn't displayed in the xref:module-url-segment.adoc#root-module-urls[module segment of its page URLs].
