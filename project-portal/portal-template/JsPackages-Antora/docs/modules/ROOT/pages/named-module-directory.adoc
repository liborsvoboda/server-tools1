= Named Module Directory

== What's a named module directory?

Named module directories are xref:module-directories.adoc#module-dir[optional module directories] located in a xref:module-directories.adoc#modules-dir[_modules_ directory].
You can create as many named module directories as you need.

<.> [.path]_pages_ family directory
<.> A source file for a page
<.> A navigation file
<.> A module directory named [.path]_get-started_

A named module directory must contain at least one xref:family-directories.adoc[family directory] with at least one source file.
A named module directory can also contain an optional navigation file.

Antora uses a module's directory name to create a <<named-module,module's name>>.
A module name is used for source-to-source referencing and as a URL segment for the publishable resources that belong to the module.
Therefore, the name of the module directory:

* Should be accessible to content writers
* Can't contain characters that aren't permitted in AsciiDoc macros and directives
* Shouldn't contain characters that inhibit web server portability, search engine optimization, or the best practices of your site's search solution
* Should meet your site's accessibility requirements

For the reasons listed above, it's important to carefully consider what you name your named module directories.
See xref:module-directory-names.adoc[] to learn about the prohibited characters and recommended practices.

[#named-module]
== What's a named module?

Source files in each named module directory become part of a named module in a xref:component-version.adoc[component version].
The name of a module corresponds to the name of a module directory.
For instance, source files stored in the [.path]_get-started_ module directory shown in <<ex-named>> will be assigned to the module `get-started`.

[#where-name-is-used]
== Where's a module's name used?

When you reference content that belongs to a named module from another module or component version, you specify the module's name in the xref:page:resource-id.adoc[resource IDs] for pages, attachments, images, examples, and partials.

The module's name is also used as a xref:module-url-segment.adoc#named-module-urls[segment in the publishable resource URLs].
