|xref:component-name-key.adoc[name]
|Component name used with `version` to identify a component version.
Used as the component coordinate in resource IDs and in the component URL segment for a component version's published resources.

|xref:component-version-key.adoc[version]
|Version used with `name` to identify a component version.
Used as the version coordinate in resource IDs and as the version segment for a component version's published resource URLs, except when a xref:component-with-no-version.adoc[component version is defined as unversioned].

Specifying the `version` key in a component version descriptor file is optional if the value of the key is inherited from the xref:playbook:content-source-version.adoc[content source in the playbook].
You can specify the `version` key on the content source if you want the value to be automatically derived from the refname or based on a refname mapping.
