= Site Keys

The playbook keys configured under `site` manage the site's published identity and how it interacts with certain applications once it's published.

[#site-key]
== site key

Global generated site files, service accounts, and other common properties are defined under the `site` key in a playbook file.
These settings are applied to the entire site when it's generated.

The `title` key in the `site` category is required.
The `url` key is optional, but recommended.
See xref:site-url.adoc#when-should-the-site-url-be-set[When should the site URL be set?] for details.
The other keys are optional; Antora will use default values if they're not specified.
Alternatively, `title`, `start_page`, and `keys` can be xref:cli:options.adoc[assigned from the CLI].
The `url` key can be assigned from the xref:cli:options.adoc#site-url[CLI] or using an xref:environment-variables.adoc[environment variable].
