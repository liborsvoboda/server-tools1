= Image Resource ID Examples

You can insert an image into any page in your site, regardless of the module or component version to which the target image file belongs.
On this page, you'll learn how to assign the correct resource ID coordinates to an image macro based on the version, component, and module the image belongs to in relation to the page where you want to embed it.

[NOTE]
====
For an overview of the block image macro and inline image macro and step-by-step instructions on how to add them to a page, see:

* xref:block-images.adoc[]
* xref:inline-images.adoc[]

If you aren't familiar with the Antora resource ID or its coordinates, see:

* xref:resource-id.adoc[]
* xref:resource-id-coordinates.adoc[]
====

TIP: All of the examples on this page, regardless of the image macro they use to demonstrate a concept, apply to both the xref:block-images.adoc[block image macro] and xref:inline-images.adoc[inline image macro].

== Use an image within a module

Most of the images you reference with an image macro will probably belong to the xref:ROOT:module-directories.adoc#module[same module] and xref:ROOT:component-version.adoc[component version] as the current page.
In such circumstances, the AsciiDoc image macros only require the xref:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-resource[file coordinate] of the target image's resource ID be assigned as a value.

[NOTE]
====
// tag::target-current-def[]
[[target]]The [.term]*target image* is the image source file that's being referenced by the current page.
The target image is referenced by assigning its resource ID to an inline or block image macro in the content of the current page.
[[current]]The [.term]*current page* is the page source file containing the image macro that references the target image.
// end::target-current-def[]
====

The structure of the target image's file coordinate varies depending on whether the target image is stored at the root of the [.path]_images_ family directory or in a subdirectory of the [.path]_images_ directory.

.current-page.adoc
[#ex-file]
----

<.> File coordinate of the target image when it's stored in a subdirectory of the [.path]_images_ directory.
<.> File coordinate of the target image when the target image and current page are stored in a subdirectory with the same family-relative directory path.
_This is an advanced use case._

The following sections provide examples showing the different file coordinate structures.

[#images-root]
=== File coordinate at images directory root

When the target image is stored at the root of the [.path]_images_ family directory, the file coordinate is the target image's filename and file extension.
Remember, the file coordinate of the target image is always calculated from the root of the [.path]_images_ family directory.

Let's use the files that belong to the component version _colorado 5.2_ as the basis for the example in this section.
The component version's source files are assigned to modules and families based on the xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc[set of standard directories] listed in <<ex-co>>.

Using the two files that belong to the _la-garita_ module, shown in <<ex-co>> above, let's insert the [.path]_wilderness-map.jpg_ image into the [.path]_ridge.adoc_ page.
That means the source file [.path]_wilderness-map.jpg_ is the target image and [.path]_ridge.adoc_ is the current page.

<<ex-image>> shows a block image macro in the [.path]_ridge.adoc_ page (current page) that references, the [.path]_wilderness-map.jpg_ image (target image).
When the target image and current page belong to the same module, only the file coordinate of the target image's resource ID needs to be entered in the image macro.

.ridge.adoc (current page)
[#ex-image]
----
The trailhead is north of town.

image::wilderness-map.jpg[]
----

In <<ex-image>>, the file coordinate for the [.path]_wilderness-map.jpg_ image is `wilderness-map.jpg`.
Its file coordinate consists solely of its filename and file extension because [.path]_wilderness-map.jpg_ is stored at the root of the [.path]_images_ directory.

If the target image is stored in a subdirectory of the [.path]_images_ directory, its file coordinate must specify the __images__-relative directory path, filename, and file extension.
See <<relative-path>> for file coordinate examples when the target image is stored in a subdirectory.

[#relative-path]
=== File coordinate with images-relative directory path

The __images__-relative directory path of the <<target,target image>> is required in its file coordinate when it's stored in a subdirectory of the [.path]_images_ directory.

Let's reference [.path]_skyline.jpg_ from [.path]_ridge.adoc_.
As you can see in <<ex-co-subdir>> above, the image and page belong to the _la-garita_ module.
In <<ex-subdir>>, an image macro in the [.path]_ridge.adoc_ page (current page) references the [.path]_skyline.jpg_ image (target image).

.ridge.adoc (current page)
[#ex-subdir]
----

image::aerial/skyline.jpg[]
----

As shown in <<ex-subdir>>, the file coordinate for [.path]_skyline.jpg_ is `aerial/skyline.jpg`.
The file coordinate for [.path]_skyline.jpg_ consists of its [.path]__images__-relative directory path, filename, and file extension because it's stored in the subdirectory [.path]_aerial_.

TIP: In special circumstances where the __images__-relative directory path of the target image and the __pages__-relative directory path of the current page are parallel, the __images__-relative directory path of the file coordinate can be replaced with the relative path token, `./`.

//[#use-image-across-modules]
[#modules]
== Use an image from another module

When the <<target,target image>> and <<current,current page>> don't belong to the same module, you must specify the target image's xref:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-module[module coordinate] and xref:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-resource[file coordinate] in the image macro.

From the _colorado 5.2_ component version, shown in <<ex-co-mod>> above, let's insert the [.path]_peak.svg_ image into the [.path]_willow-creek.adoc_ page.
That means the source file [.path]_peak.svg_ is the target image and [.path]_willow-creek.adoc_ is the current page.

<<ex-module>> shows an inline image macro in [.path]_willow-creek.adoc_ (current page) that references the image file [.path]_peak.svg_ (target image).
The module and file coordinates of the target image's resource ID are assigned to the image macro.
The [.path]_willow-creek.adoc_ page belongs to the _la-garita_ module.
The [.path]_peak.svg_ image belongs to the _ROOT_ module.

As shown in <<ex-module>>, the target image's module coordinate is `ROOT` and its file coordinate is `peak.svg`.

In <<ex-module-subdir>>, let's embed the [.path]_skyline.jpg_ image (target image) into [.path]_ranges.adoc_ (current page).
The [.path]_skyline.jpg_ image belongs to the _la-garita_ module and [.path]_ranges.adoc_ belongs to the _ROOT_ module.

As shown in <<ex-module-subdir>>, the target image's module coordinate is `la-garita` and its file coordinate is `aerial/skyline.jpg` because it's stored in the [.path]_aerial_ subdirectory of the [.path]_images_ family directory.

//[#use-image-in-different-docs-component]
[#component-versions]
== Use an image from another docs component

When the <<target,target image>> and <<current,current page>> belong to different documentation components, you must specify, at a minimum, the target image's xref:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-component[component, module, and file coordinates] in the image macro.
You'll almost always specify the version coordinate, too.

Let's use the files that belong to the component versions _colorado 5.2_ (<<ex-co-v>>) and _wyoming 1.0_ (<<ex-wy>>) as the basis for the example in this section.

<.> Defines subsequent files as images
<.> Defines subsequent files as pages

Using files from <<ex-co-v>> and <<ex-wy>>, let's insert [.path]_panorama.png_ (target image) into [.path]_ranges.adoc_ (current page).
The image [.path]_panorama.png_ belongs to the _sierra-madre_ module of _wyoming 1.0_.
In <<ex-across-components>>, the resource ID assigned to the image macro specifies the version, component, module, and file coordinates of the target image because the target image belongs to the _wyoming 1.0_ component version whereas the current page belongs to _colorado 5.2_.

.Insert panorama.png (target image) as a block image into ranges.adoc (current page)
[#ex-across-components]
----
image::1.0@wyoming:sierra-madre:panorama.png[]
----

As shown in <<ex-across-components>>, the target image's version coordinate is `1.0`, its component coordinate is `wyoming`, its module coordinate is `sierra-madre`, and its file coordinate is `panorama.png`.

Now, in <<ex-across-components-root>>, let's insert [.path]_peak.svg_ (target image) into [.path]_wilderness-areas.adoc_ (current page).
The [.path]_peak.svg_ image belongs to the component version _colorado 5.2_.
The [.path]_wilderness-areas.adoc_ page belongs to the component version _wyoming 1.0_.

.wilderness-areas.adoc (current page)
[#ex-across-components-root]
----
image:5.2@colorado::peak.svg[] Bridger Peak is in the Sierra Madre range.
----

Notice in <<ex-across-components-root>> that the module coordinate `ROOT` seems to be missing from the resource ID.
When a component coordinate is specified in a resource ID, and the target image belongs to the _ROOT_ module, the module coordinate `ROOT` doesn't have to be explicitly specified.
But you must still enter the colon (`:`) that would follow the module coordinate.
You can see this `:` directly before the file coordinate `peak.svg`.
This shorthand only works when a component coordinate is specified and the module coordinate of the target image is `ROOT`.
In all other cases where the module coordinate is required, the name of the module must be specified.

You may have noticed that the version coordinate is specified in both <<ex-across-components>> and <<ex-across-components-root>>.
If you don't specify the version, Antora will complete the resource ID of the target image using the version coordinate of the target image's latest component version at runtime.

//[#use-latest-version-of-image]
[#latest-version]
=== Use the latest version of an image

TIP: This behavior only applies when the target image and current page belong to different docs components!

If a version isn't specified in the resource ID, *and the target image and current page belong to different documentation components*, Antora uses the version coordinate of the xref:ROOT:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc#latest-version[latest version] of the target image's component to complete the resource ID at runtime.

Let's use the files that belong to _colorado 5.2_ (<<ex-co-v>> in the previous section), _wyoming 1.0_ (<<ex-wy>> in the previous section), and _wyoming 1.5_ (<<ex-wy-latest>> below) as the basis for the example in this section.

<.> Defines the component version as _wyoming 1.5_

Let's reference the [.path]_panorama.png_ image (target image) from [.path]_index.adoc_ (current page).
[.path]_index.adoc_ belongs to the _colorado 5.2_ component version .
There are two files named [.path]_panorama.png_ that belong to the _wyoming_ component, _sierra-madre_ module, and _images_ family.
One [.path]_panorama.png_ belongs to version _1.0_, the other [.path]_panorama.png_ to version _1.5_.

<<ex-across-components-latest>> shows a block image macro referencing [.path]_panorama.png_ (target image) from [.path]_index.adoc_ (current page).
Notice that the target image's version coordinate isn't specified.

.index.adoc (current page)
[#ex-across-components-latest]
----
image::wyoming:sierra-madre:panorama.png[]
----

When Antora runs, it will identify _wyoming 1.5_ as the latest version of the _wyoming_ component according to its xref:ROOT:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc#version-sorting-rules[version sorting rules] and xref:ROOT:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc#latest-version[latest version criteria].
Because a version coordinate isn't specified in <<ex-across-components-latest>>, Antora will complete the resource ID assigned to the image macro using the version coordinate -- `1.5` -- of the latest _wyoming_ component.

WARNING: This behavior of linking to the latest version only applies when the version coordinate is unspecified and the target image and current page belong to different components.
If the version and component coordinates aren't specified in the resource ID, Antora assumes the target image belongs to the same component version as the current page and uses the current page's version and component coordinates to complete the target image's resource ID.
