= Resource ID Coordinates

[#id-coordinates]
== Coordinate syntax and order

A xref:resource-id.adoc#whats-a-resource-id[resource ID] contains five coordinates: version, component, module, family, and file.
Antora constructs a resource ID for a source file by assigning values to these coordinates based on the file, xref:ROOT:standard-directories.adoc[standard directory set], and information in the xref:ROOT:component-version-descriptor.adoc[component version descriptor].
You can reference a resource from any other resource--regardless of the component version each resource belongs to--using a sequence of the resource ID coordinates assigned to a resource.

<<fig-full-id>> shows the coordinate types and their sequence in a fully qualified resource ID.

.Fully qualified resource ID
[#fig-full-id]
image::full-resource-id.svg[Diagram of a fully qualified Antora resource ID]

[[full-id]]A [.term]*fully qualified resource ID* is a resource ID with all of its coordinates specified.
You probably won't have to use a resource's fully qualified resource ID that often.
The number of resource ID coordinates you specify when referencing a resource depends on:

* the component version and module of the current page in relation to the target resource,
* the family of the target resource, and
* the AsciiDoc syntax used to reference the target resource.

[[target]]The [.term]*target resource* is the resource source file that's referenced, by specifying its resource ID, in an AsciiDoc macro, include directive, or other syntax.
[[current]]The [.term]*current page* is the page file that contains the AsciiDoc syntax that references the target resource.

.The current page, with the filename satellites.adoc, containing an xref macro referencing a resource
[#fig-target]
image::target-resource.svg[Example of an xref in the current page referencing a target resource]

In <<fig-target>>, [.path]_satellites.adoc_ is the current page and the resource with the filename _modes.adoc_ is the target resource being referenced by the xref macro.
The following sections describe how to determine the value of each coordinate for a target resource and when to use each coordinate.

[#id-version]
== Version coordinate

The version coordinate is the same value as the version of the component to which the <<target,target resource>> belongs.
The value of the version is assigned to the xref:ROOT:component-version-key.adoc[version key].
The `version` key is specified either in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file that defines the resource's component version or on the content source in your playbook that specified from where Antora collected the component version's files.

The version coordinate should be used to reference a resource in a different version of the same component or a specific version of a different component.
When entering a version coordinate in a resource ID, it should always be the first coordinate and end with an at sign (`@`).
If the component coordinate is not specified, the current component will be used.
If the component coordinate is specified without specifying a version coordinate, the latest version of that component will be choosen.

[#id-component]
== Component coordinate

The component coordinate is the name of the component to which the target resource belongs.
The component name is specified by the xref:ROOT:component-name-key.adoc[name key] in the [.path]_antora.yml_ file that defines the resource's component version.

The component coordinate must be used when the target resource and current page belong to different documentation components.
The component name is entered before the module coordinate in a resource ID and is directly followed by one colon (`:`).
If the component coordinate is specified without specifying a version coordinate, the latest version of that component will be choosen.

[#id-module]
== Module coordinate

The module coordinate is the name of the module to which the target resource belongs.
The module name is derived from the xref:ROOT:module-directories.adoc#module[module directory] where the resource is stored.

The module coordinate must be used when the target resource and current page belong to different modules.
The module name is entered before the family coordinate, if the family coordinate is present, or before the file coordinate if the family coordinate isn't present.
The module name is directly followed by one colon (`:`).

When a module coordinate ends with the name of a built-in AsciiDoc macro, such as `link`, `kbd`, `menu`, etc., you may have to escape that portion of the coordinate by prefixing the macro name with a backslash.
For example, module coordinates such as `monolink` and `redmenu` may need to be entered as `mono\link` and `red\menu` in a resource ID.

[#id-family]
== Family coordinate

The family coordinate identifies the name of the family to which the target resource belongs.
The family is derived from the xref:ROOT:family-directories.adoc[family directory] where the resource is stored.
Remove the "`s`" at the end of the family's name and replace it with a dollar sign (`$`) when constructing a resource ID.
The valid family coordinates are `page$`, `image$`, `partial$`, `example$`, and `attachment$`.

Whether the family coordinate needs to be entered in a resource ID depends on:

* the family of the target resource, and
* the AsciiDoc syntax used to reference the target resource.

For example, if you reference a page using the xref macro, the `page$` family coordinate isn't required because the xref macro applies it by default when no family coordinate is specified.
The following table lists when the family coordinate is required depending on the resource being referenced and the syntax that is referencing the resource.

[#id-resource]
== File coordinate

The file coordinate specifies the path, relative to the xref:ROOT:family-directories.adoc[family directory], of the target resource's source file.
The file coordinate must specify the resource's file extension except when:

* the target resource doesn't have a file extension, such as _Dockerfile_, *and*
* the target resource is a xref:partials.adoc[partial] or xref:examples.adoc[example].

The file coordinate for a resource stored at the root of a family directory is the name of the resource's source file and its file extension.

.Resource stored at root of family directory
[listing#ex-family]
----
ðŸ“‚ modules
  ðŸ“‚ admin
    ðŸ“‚ pages <.>
      ðŸ“„ modes.adoc <.>
----
<.> [.path]_pages_ family directory
<.> Page stored at the root of the [.path]_pages_ directory

For example, the file coordinate for [.path]_modes.adoc_, shown in <<ex-family>>, is `modes.adoc` because it's stored at the root of the [.path]_pages_ family directory.

If the target resource is located in a subdirectory of a family directory, the file coordinate must specify the family-relative directory path to the target resource.

<.> Subdirectory in the [.path]_pages_ directory
<.> Subdirectory in the [.path]_fields_ subdirectory
<.> Page stored in [.path]_level_ subdirectory
<.> Page stored in [.path]_level_ subdirectory

The page [.path]_terrain.adoc_, shown in <<ex-sub>>, is stored in the [.path]_level_ subdirectory.
The file coordinate for [.path]_terrain.adoc_ is `fields/level/terrain.adoc`.
If [.path]_modes.adoc_ (current page) references [.path]_terrain.adoc_ (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource's resource ID is `fields/level/terrain.adoc`.
If [.path]_terrain.adoc_ (current page) references [.path]_modes.adoc_ (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource's resource ID is `modes.adoc`.
*Remember, the file coordinate of the target resource is always calculated from the family directory.*

When the target resource and current page are both located in the same subdirectory of a family directory, the relative path token, `./`, can be used to abbreviate the family-relative directory path of the target resource's file coordinate.

.Resources stored in the same subdirectory

          ðŸ“„ terrain.adoc <.>
----
<.> Page stored in [.path]_level_ subdirectory
<.> Page stored in [.path]_level_ subdirectory

The pages [.path]_routes.adoc_ and [.path]_terrain.adoc_, shown in <<ex-token>>, are both stored in the [.path]_level_ subdirectory.
If [.path]_routes.adoc_ (current page) references [.path]_terrain.adoc_ (target resource), the file coordinate specified in the target resource's resource ID can be specified as `./terrain.adoc` instead of `fields/level/terrain.adoc`.
