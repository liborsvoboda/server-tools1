# Playground Examples

Add examples to the playground by adding files to this directory with the
`.txt` file extension. Examples with file names ending in `.gotip.txt` are only
displayed on the gotip playground.

Each example must start with a line beginning with "// Title:", specifying the
title of the example in the selection menu. This title line will be stripped
from the example before serving.
